# Greetings! I'm [Abuzar Sherazi](https://abuzar.live) ðŸ’»
As a driven full-stack web developer with 3+ years of experience, leaning more towards backend engineering, I thrive on creativity and precision to deliver scalable performant systems. I have believed that a proper engineer ought to acquire all that is needed solve whichever problem he might confront creating solutions. So I learned lots and worked with lots of tools including softwares, languages and frameworks, including Next.js, Golang, Rust, Django, Unity, and many more as I get deeper into the field and tackle more problems.

I graduated from the [University Of Central Punjab](https://ucp.edu.pk/) in October 2024, and I currently work as a Backend Engineer at Devflow. My role involves designing and implementing efficient backend systems, leading and collaborating with cross-functional teams, and driving innovation in every project. I am committed to continuous learning, staying abreast of emerging trends, and pushing the boundaries of web development.
